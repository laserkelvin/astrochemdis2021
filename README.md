## Finding Unknown Unknowns for Astrochemistry with Broadband Rotational Spectroscopy

### Abstract

A large portion of molecular discoveries in the interstellar medium have been motivated and guided by exhaustive laboratory studies. These experiments provide, for instance, precise rest frequencies and reactive branching ratios in typically targeted studies focusing on specific molecules of interest. With the advent of broadband chirped-pulse microwave spectroscopy, we are now able to collect rotational spectra over many gigahertz—closer to the capabilities of many radio telescopes—covering multiple transitions for potentially many molecules at high signal-to-noise within only a few hours of integration. With these capabilities, we have access to rapid experimental assays covering different precursors and other experimental parameters; the potential discovery space is enormous.

In this talk, I will present exhaustive studies of unbiased assays of benzene in electrical discharges, conducted at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, which highlight just how much new data we can obtain in single experiments. Moreover, these experiments demonstrate how automation of spectroscopic analysis is highly necessary where high quality data can be obtained at a higher cadence than can be regularly analyzed; I will discuss the open-source tools (PySpecTools, https://github.com/laserkelvin/pyspectools) we have recently developed that simultaneously decreases the amount of human oversight required, thereby improving the overall reproducibility and collaborative nature of spectral analysis. Overall, these improvements allow the focus of analysis to be shifted towards unknown unknowns—potentially new molecules and states that are previously unknown and unsought that are of interest to molecular astrophysics.
